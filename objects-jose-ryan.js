// Challenges
// Consider this variable:
var person = {
  firstName: "Arthur",
  lastName: "Dent"
}
// Write the code that accesses the first name of the person object.
console.log(person.firstName)

// Write the code that accesses the last name of the person object.
console.log(person.lastName)

// Write the code that gives the person object a property of homePlanet and set it to 'Earth'.
person.homePlanet = "Earth"

console.log(person.homePlanet)

// Update the person object with a method that logs "Arthur Dent is from planet Earth".
console.log(`${person.firstName} ${person.lastName} is from planet ${person.homePlanet}`)

// Consider this variable:
var product = {
  name: "chair", price: 14.99
}
// Write a function called describeProduct takes product as an argument and logs "The product is a chair. It costs $14.99".

const describeProduct = (string) => {
  return `The product is a ${product.name}. It costs ${product.price}`
}

console.log(describeProduct(product))

// Consider this variable:
var lunch = {
  name: "PB and Banana",
  type: "sandwich",
  ingredients: ["bread", "peanut butter", "banana"]
}

// Write the code that accesses the ingredients property.
console.log(lunch.ingredients)

// Write the code that access the 3rd ingredient of the lunch object.
console.log(lunch.ingredients[2])

// Write a function that takes the lunch object as an argument and returns "The ingredients for a PB and Banana sandwich are bread, peanut butter, and banana."

const lunchObject = (string) => {
  return `The ingredients for a PB and Banana sandwich are ${lunch.ingredients}.`
}

console.log(lunchObject(lunch))


// Update the lunch object with method that returns "The ingredients for a PB and Banana sandwich are bread, peanut butter, and banana."

console.log(`The ingredients for a PB and Banana sandwich are ${lunch.ingredients}.`);


// Consider this variable:
var animals = [
  { name: "Waffles", type: "dog", age: 12 },
  { name: "Fluffy", type: "cat", age: 14 },
  { name: "Spelunky", type: "dog", age: 4 },
  { name: "Hank", type: "cat", age: 11 },
]
// Create a function that takes in any array of objects and returns a new array with only those of type cat.


var onlyCat = animals.filter(value => value.type === "cat")
console.log(onlyCat)


// Using the same array of objects above. Create a function that returns a new array with only the names of the animals.

const onlyNames = (array) => {
  return array.map(value => {
    return value.name
  })
}
console.log(onlyNames(animals))



// Consider this variable:
let author = {
    name: "H. G. Wells",
    genre: "science fiction"
}

// Write the code that destructures the author object and makes the following work:
let {name, genre} = author

console.log(`${name} is a ${genre} author`)
// --> "H. G. Wells is a science fiction author"



// Consider this variable:
let pokeOne = {
    species: "Charmandar",
    pokemon_type: "Fire"
}

let pokeTwo = {
    species: "Magikarp",
    pokemon_type: "Water"
}
// Write a function called describePokemon() that take an object like the ones above and uses destructuring to return a description of the Pokemon such that:

const describePokemon = (object) => {
  let {species, pokemon_type} = object
  return `${species} is a ${pokemon_type} pokemon`
}

console.log(describePokemon(pokeOne))
// --> "Charmandar is a Fire pokemon"

console.log(describePokemon(pokeTwo))
// // --> "Magikarp is a Water pokemon"
